Kubeon is more than just a font, it is a visual statement, a strong presence that immediately captures attention. As a monospaced font, Kubeon imposes a rare rigor and homogeneity, while standing out with its unique construction.

Designed from a strict square grid, each Kubeon character reflects a carefully calibrated architecture. The proportions ensure impeccable visual balance, where each letter fits into a defined square frame. This geometric constraint is not a limit, but a source of inspiration: it gives Kubeon a strong and recognizable identity.
